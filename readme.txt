== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin add database tables, store options, insert custom post type content, add blocks or scheduled actions? =

No, not, zero, none.

= How do I change the autoplay interval? =

<code>add_filter( 'wf_coblocks_post-carousel_interval', function( int $interval ):int {
	
	
	$interval = 10;	// Seconds
	return $interval;
} );</code>

= How do I disable the autoplay pause on hover? =

<code>add_filter( 'wf_coblocks_post-carousel_pauseonhover', '__return_false' );</code>

= How do I restrict autoplay to only selected blocks/carousels or posts/pages? =

<code>add_filter( 'wf_coblocks_post-carousel_class', function( string $class ): string {
	$class = 'my-autoplay';	// Or whatever valid css class you wish to use
	return $class;
} );</code>

Then add this css class to the selected CoBlocks Post Carousel blocks under the Advanced section in the editor. Other carousels will then not autoplay.
